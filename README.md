## 1. High-Value Customers with Multiple Products

### 🧠 Problem Scenario

The business wants to identify **customers** who are actively using **both savings and investment products**. This helps target users with cross-selling opportunities.

---

### 📌 Task

Write a query to:

- Find customers who have at least **one funded savings plan** AND **one funded investment plan**
- Include their owner_id, name, count of savings and investment plans, and total deposits
- Only consider savings accounts with **successful transactions**
- Sort results by **total deposits (descending)**

---

### 🛠️ Methodology

#### 1. Data Segmentation via CTEs
Used Common Table Expressions (`WITH`) to separate logic for clarity:
- `savings_summary`: filters users with at least one successful transaction.
- `plan_summary`: aggregates each user's savings and investment plans, including total deposits.

#### 2. Conditional Aggregation
Applied `SUM(CASE WHEN ...)` to count the number of plan types (savings vs. investment) per user.

#### 3. Filtering for Qualified Users
After joining the user and summary tables:
- Only users with both a savings and investment plan were selected (`ps.savings_count > 0 AND ps.investment_count > 0`).

#### 4. Ordering by Business Value
Sorted the results by `total_deposits DESC` to prioritize users contributing the most financially.

---

### ✅ Output Example

| owner_id | name      | savings_count | investment_count | total_deposits |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1001     | John Doe  | 2              | 1                 | 15000.00       |

---

### 🗃️ Tables Used

- `new_users_customer`: customer demographic and contact information.
- `new_savings_savingsaccount`: Records of deposit transactions.
- `new_plans_plan`: Records of plans created by customers.

---

### ⚙️ Challenges Faced & Solutions

#### 1. Lost Connection to MySQL Server
- **Issue**: Query failed with *"Lost connection to MySQL server during query"* after 30 seconds.
- **Root Cause**: MySQL default timeout settings combined with data size (~106,000+ rows in `new_savings_savingsaccount`).
- **Solution**: Attempted to increase client timeout settings. Ultimately optimized the query by:
  - Reducing row operations before the final join using CTEs.
  - Filtering and aggregating earlier to reduce memory and time cost.

#### 2. Boolean Columns Misinterpreted
- **Issue**: `is_a_fund` and `is_regular_savings` returned integers (0/1), not booleans.
- **Solution**: Used `CASE WHEN column = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0` to ensure clarity and correct aggregation in `SUM()`.

#### 3. Misleading Test Data
- **Issue**: Query showed no results due to test filters like `is_a_fund > 1`, which didn’t match the 0/1 data.
- **Solution**: Corrected the logic to `is_a_fund = 1` and validated with known `owner_id`s.

#### 4. Initial Join Logic Issues
- **Issue**: Earlier query versions joined all tables directly and miscounted savings vs. investment plans.
- **Solution**: Separated logic into CTEs for clarity and efficiency. This prevented data duplication and ensured accurate counts.

---

### 💡 Why This Approach?

- **CTEs** improve readability and separation of concerns.
- **Joins** ensure data completeness across related tables.
- **Business logic** is enforced cleanly: only users who meet both financial engagement criteria are returned.

---

### 🚀 Optimization Note

The query was built to handle performance efficiently, considering filters (`transaction_status = 'success'`) and grouping before final joins.

---

### 📈 Business Use Case

This result can feed directly into:
- Marketing automation tools for **cross-sell campaigns**
- CRM dashboards to highlight **top-tier clients**
- Strategic planning for **financial product bundling**

---

## 2. Transaction Frequency Analysis

### 🧠 Problem Scenario

The finance team wants to analyze how often customers transact to help segment them into tiers such as **frequent**, **moderate**, or **occasional** users.

---

### 📌 Task

Write a query to:

- Calculate the **average number of successful transactions per customer per month**.
- Categorize each customer as:
  - **High Frequency**: ≥10 transactions/month
  - **Medium Frequency**: 3–9 transactions/month
  - **Low Frequency**: ≤2 transactions/month
- Aggregate and return the **count of customers** and the **average monthly transactions** in each segment.

---

### 🛠️ Methodology

#### 1. Aggregation of Customer Transactions
- Used a CTE `customer_transactions` to **count total successful transactions** per customer from `new_savings_savingsaccount`.

#### 2. Monthly Normalization
- Created a second CTE `customer_frequency` to **normalize** total transactions over the available period (**105 months** from Aug 2016 to Apr 2025).
- Used `ROUND(CAST(total_transactions AS DECIMAL) / 105, 2)` to get the monthly average.

#### 3. Frequency Segmentation
- Used a CASE statement in the `categorized_customers` CTE to classify customers into:
  - `"High Frequency"`: `avg >= 10`
  - `"Medium Frequency"`: `avg >= 3 and < 10`
  - `"Low Frequency"`: `< 3`

#### 4. Final Aggregation
- Counted how many customers fell into each category.
- Calculated the **average of their monthly averages** per category using `AVG(avg_transactions_per_month)`.

---

### ✅ Output Example

| frequency_category | customer_count | avg_transactions_per_month |
|--------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| High Frequency     | 250            | 15.2                        |
| Medium Frequency   | 1200           | 5.5                         |
| Low Frequency      | 730            | 1.1                         |

---

### 🗃️ Tables Used

- `users_customuser`:  Customer demographic and contact information.
- `new_savings_savingsaccount`:  Records of deposit transactions.

---

### ⚙️ Challenges Faced & Solutions

#### 1. Time Range Spanning Multiple Years
- **Issue**: Some customers had inconsistent activity across years; others had **zero transactions** for certain years.
- **Solution**: Normalized all customers over a **fixed 105-month window** to ensure fair comparison regardless of when they joined or transacted.

#### 2. Name-Based Duplicates
- **Issue**: Same names appeared multiple times with different transaction counts.
- **Solution**: Switched to using `id` instead of `name` as the primary identifier for accuracy.

#### 3. Missing Customer Records
- **Issue**: Some customers didn’t appear due to no transactions.
- **Solution**: Used a **LEFT JOIN** from `users_customuser` to ensure inclusion of all customers even if they had 0 transactions.

#### 4. Misleading Assumptions About Monthly Averages
- **Issue**: Initially considered per-year breakdowns, which could overinflate or underrepresent activity.
- **Solution**: Used a **uniform 105-month period** as the denominator to ensure consistent classification.

---

### 💡 Why This Approach?

- Ensures **consistent segmentation** by calculating average across entire dataset lifespan (Aug 2016 – Apr 2025).
- Avoids bias from missing years by treating no-transaction periods as part of the customer’s activity timeline.
- Uses clear classification logic that can easily plug into dashboards or customer profiles.

---

### 🚀 Optimization Note

- CTEs allow layered logic and clear debugging.
- Aggregation is done in steps to reduce intermediate complexity.
- Can scale easily if data range or thresholds change in the future.

---

### 📈 Business Use Case

Results from this query can inform:
- Customer segmentation for **tiered service plans**
- Frequency-based rewards or loyalty programs
- Early detection of **inactive or churning customers**

---

## 3. Inactive Accounts with No Inflows for over 1 Year

### 🧠 Problem Scenario

The operations team wants to **identify accounts that have not received any inflow transactions over the past year(365 days)**.

---

### 📌 Task

Write a query to:

- Find all accounts that are either **Savings** or **Investment**
- Only consider **inflow transactions** (i.e., `confirmed_amount > 0`)
- Return:
  - `plan_id`
  - `owner_id`
  - Account `type` ("Savings" or "Investment")
  - `last_transaction_date`
  - Number of `inactivity_days`
- Exclude accounts that **have had inflow transactions in the past 365 days**
- Sort results by `inactivity_days` in descending order

---

### 🛠️ Methodology

#### 1. Account Classification
Used conditional logic on boolean columns:
- `is_regular_savings = 1` → **Savings**
- `is_a_fund = 1` → **Investment**

#### 2. Filtering Inflow Transactions
- Joined with the `new_savings_savingsaccount` table
- Included only transactions with `confirmed_amount > 0` to capture **actual inflows**

#### 3. CTE for Activity Summary
Used a Common Table Expression (`WITH`) to:
- Summarize `MAX(transaction_date)` as the most recent inflow per account
- Assign account type
- Group by account ID and owner

#### 4. Inactivity Calculation
- Used `DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, COALESCE(last_transaction_date, CURRENT_DATE))` to calculate days of inactivity
- Accounts with no inflow in **over a year (365 days)** were selected

---

### ✅ Output Example

| plan_id | owner_id | type       | last_transaction_date | inactivity_days |
|---------|----------|------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| 1001    | 305      | Savings    | 2023-08-10             | 370             |
| 1023    | 578      | Investment | 2022-12-25             | 510             |

---

### 🗃️ Tables Used

- `new_plans_plan`: Records of plans created by customers.
- `new_savings_savingsaccount`: Records of deposit transactions.

---

### ⚙️ Challenges Faced & Solutions

#### 1. Function Compatibility
- **Issue**: Tried using `DATE_PART()` which is not supported in MySQL.
- **Solution**: Replaced with `DATEDIFF()` for MySQL compatibility.

#### 2. Ambiguity in Task
- **Issue**: The scenario specified "no inflow", but the task said "no transactions".
- **Solution**: Interpreted based on scenario and filtered only on `confirmed_amount > 0` to focus on inflows.

#### 3. Missing `is_active` Field
- **Issue**: The `is_active` column was in a different table not listed (`new_users_customer`).
- **Solution**: Ignored that constraint since the task restricts us to only the two listed tables.

---

### 💡 Why This Approach?

- **CTE** helps structure logic in layers and improve readability.
- **Conditional classification** ensures correct labeling of accounts.
- **Filtering on inflow** aligns with business requirements to identify dormant value-generating accounts.

---

### 🚀 Optimization Note

The query avoids heavy joins and works efficiently by:
- Filtering and aggregating within the CTE before final selection
- Using `LEFT JOIN` to retain accounts even if they have no transactions

---

### 📈 Business Use Case

This result can be used to:
- Trigger **reactivation campaigns** via SMS, email, or calls
- Understand **customer churn risk**
- Feed into user segmentation for **incentive-based re-engagement**
